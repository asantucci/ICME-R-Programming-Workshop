# Workshop Description
This R programming workshop will cover some basics of R, including the following
  * Data visualization(s),
  * `data.frame`'s (and to build up to this, we will cover a few other _data-types_, e.g. `List` or `vector`'s)
  * Data manipulation (i.e. how to work efficiently with `data.frame`'s)
  
Workshop materials will include an appendix of slightly more advanced topics,
e.g. how to aggregate and reshape data and also construct a linear model; these
will not directly be covered in the live course, however.

I am a computational mathematician, currently practicing Data Science and Engineering at Google and Lecturing at Stanford University. At Google, I work on YouTube recommendation algorithms and core statistical inference, and at Stanford I teach graduate students in STEM fields how to develop software in Python and C++. My research interests formerly lay at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, but more recently I have been developing a passion for (deep) learning algorithms. In general, I strongly believe in leveraging AI for social good. I serve as a volunteer board member for the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics where I specialize in the education committee. I've been privileged to work closely under the guidance of Nobel Laureates on two separate occasions (Daniel McFadden and Guido Imbens).

My undergraduate curricula was spread across communications and economics. In graduate school, I pursued a skillset in computational and mathematical engineering at ICME, with an emphasis on Data Science. Whilst there, I passed Ph.D. qualifying exams in both Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms and also Stochastic Processes. I was advised on my M.S. thesis by Guido Imbens, now a Nobel Laureate.
